# MULTI TODO LIST

## Description

This is a simple todo list app that allows you to create multiple lists. I know, no big deal. So what's with all the fuzz? It's main purpose is to be a learning tool for me. I'm using it to learn the different approaches to the same algorithms in various frameworks and as a playground for students to learn new technologies.
